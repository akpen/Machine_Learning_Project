# Machine_Learning_Project

A collection of research and code for the Machine Learning project for CUSP-GX 5006.001

### Contributors:
1) Akshay Penmatcha
2) Priyanshi Singh
3) Sunny Kulkarni

### Major tasks of our project:

1) Identifying the Key feature/object/thing that we need to be classifying (Problem Statement)     - Think about urban context and research accordingly
2) Identifying the Data Source so that we can create an Image Library that we want to analyze
3) Learn and Apply the Feature Extraction techniques using Image Processing

Optional: Label the Training Dataset using Amazon Mechanical Turk (if needed)

4) Build the Final Data Table with relevant features and Labels
5) Apply ML Algorithm (Decision Trees/Clustering etc.) to the Training Dataset
6) Test the Model on New Data and check for Accuracy

Optional: Apply any other concepts ML or Deep Learning to make the model more accurate/precise

7) Design the Flow of the Final Presentation(Major Topics to be covered) and prepare the presentation
8) Design the Flow of the Final Report(Major Topics to be covered) and coordinate with others to write the report.
